+/// AGS Library Overview
+/// --------------------
+/// This document provides an overview of the AGS (AMD GPU Services) library. The AGS library provides software developers with the ability to query
+/// AMD GPU software and hardware state information that is not normally available through standard operating systems or graphic APIs.
+///
+/// The latest version of the API is publicly hosted here: https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AGS_SDK/.
+/// It is also worth checking http://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/amd-gpu-services-ags-library/ for any updates and articles on AGS.
+/// \internal
+/// Online documentation is publicly hosted here: http://gpuopen-librariesandsdks.github.io/ags/

+///
+/// What's new in AGS 5.1.1 since version 5.0.6
+/// ---------------------------------------
+/// AGS 5.1.1 includes the following updates:
+/// * An API change for DX11 extensions
+///   - It is now mandatory to call agsDriverExtensionsDX11_CreateDevice() when creating a device if the user wants to access any DX11 AMD extensions.
+///   - The corresponding agsDriverExtensionsDX11_DestroyDevice() call must be called to release the device and free up the internal resources allocated by the create call.
+/// * App registration extension for DX11.
+/// * Freesync 2 HDR support.
+/// * Wave reduce and wave scan shader extensions.
+/// * AMD user markers for DX12.
+/// * Eyefinity bug fixes.
+/// * MultiDrawIndexedInstancedIndirectCountIndirect parameter bug fix.
+/// * Static lib versions of the binary.
+/// * VS2017 support for the samples.
+///
+/// What's new in AGS 5.x since version 4.x
+/// ---------------------------------------
+/// Version 5.x is a major overhaul of the library designed to provide a much clearer view of the GPUs in the system and the displays attached to them.
+/// It also exposes the ability to query each display for HDR capabilities and put those HDR capable displays into various HDR modes.
+/// Some functions such as agsGetGPUMemorySize and agsGetEyefinityConfigInfo have been removed in favor of including this information in the device & display enumeration.
+/// Features include:
+/// * Full GPU enumeration with adapter string, device id, revision id and vendor id.
+/// * Per GPU display enumeration including information on display name, resolution and HDR capabilities.
+/// * Optional user supplied memory allocator.
+/// * Function to set displays into HDR mode.
+/// * A Microsoft WACK compliant version of the library.
+/// * DirectX11 shader compiler controls.
+/// * DirectX11 multiview extension enabling MultiView and MultiRes rendering.
+/// * DirectX11 Crossfire API now supports using the API without needing a driver profile. Can also specify the transfer engine.
+///
+/// Using the AGS library
+/// ---------------------
+/// It is recommended to take a look at the source code for the samples that come with the AGS SDK:
+/// * AGSSample
+/// * CrossfireSample
+/// * EyefinitySample
+/// The AGSSample application is the simplest of the three examples and demonstrates the code required to initialize AGS and use it to query the GPU and Eyefinity state.
+/// The CrossfireSample application demonstrates the use of the new API to transfer resources on GPUs in Crossfire mode. Lastly, the EyefinitySample application provides a more
+/// extensive example of Eyefinity setup than the basic example provided in AGSSample.
+/// There are other samples on Github that demonstrate the DirectX shader extensions, such as the Barycentrics11 and Barycentrics12 samples.
+///
+/// To add AGS support to an existing project, follow these steps:
+/// * Link your project against the correct import library. Choose from either the 32 bit or 64 bit version.
+/// * Copy the AGS dll into the same directory as your game executable.
+/// * Include the amd_ags.h header file from your source code.
+/// * Include the AGS hlsl files if you are using the shader intrinsics.
+/// * Declare a pointer to an AGSContext and make this available for all subsequent calls to AGS.
+/// * On game initialization, call agsInit() passing in the address of the context. On success, this function will return a valid context pointer.
+/// * The agsInit() function should be called before the D3D device is created if the Crossfire mode is specified.
+///
+/// Don't forget to cleanup AGS by calling agsDeInit() when the app exits, after the device has been destroyed.

+/// This feature is supported in Radeon Software Version 17.9.2 onwards.
+/// Rules:
+/// * AppName or EngineName must be set, but both are not required. Engine profiles will be used only if app specific profiles do not exist.
+/// * In an engine, the EngineName should be set, so a default profile can be built. If an app modifies the engine, the AppName should be set, to allow a profile for the specific app.
+/// * Version number is not mandatory, but heavily suggested. The use of which can prevent the use of profiles for incompatible versions (for instance engine versions that introduce or change features), and can help prevent older profiles from being used (and introducing new bugs) before the profile is tested with new app builds.
+/// * If Version numbers are used and a new version is introduced, a new profile will not be enabled until an AMD engineer has been able to update a previous profile, or make a new one.
+///
+/// The cases for profile selection are as follows:
+///
+/// |Case|Profile Applied|
+/// |----|---------------|
+/// | App or Engine Version has profile | The profile is used. |
+/// | App or Engine Version num < profile version num | The closest profile > the version number is used. |
+/// | App or Engine Version num > profile version num | No profile selected/The previous method is used. |
+/// | App and Engine Version have profile | The App's profile is used. |
+/// | App and Engine Version num < profile version | The closest App profile > the version number is used. |
+/// | App and Engine Version, no App profile found | The Engine profile will be used. |

+///
+/// The Quad List extension is a convenient way to submit quads without using an index buffer. Note that this still submits two triangles at the driver level.

+/// \note Note that this will not return valid interpolated values, only valid SV_Position values.

+/// \defgroup breadcrumbs Breadcrumb API
+/// API for writing top-of-pipe and bottom-of-pipe markers to help track down GPU hangs.
+///
+/// The API is available if the \ref AGS_DX11_EXTENSION_BREADCRUMB_MARKERS is present in \ref AGSDX11ReturnedParams::extensionsSupported.
+///
+/// To use the API, a non zero value needs to be specificed in \ref AGSDX11ExtensionParams::numBreadcrumbMarkers.  This enables the API (if available) and allocates a system memory buffer
+/// which is returned to the user in \ref AGSDX11ReturnedParams::breadcrumbBuffer.
+///
+/// The user can now write markers before and after draw calls using \ref agsDriverExtensionsDX11_WriteBreadcrumb.
+///
+/// \section background Background
+///
+/// A top-of-pipe (TOP) command is scheduled for execution as soon as the command processor (CP) reaches the command.
+/// A bottom-of-pipe (BOP) command is scheduled for execution once the previous rendering commands (draw and dispatch) finish execution.
+/// TOP and BOP commands do not block CP. i.e. the CP schedules the command for execution then proceeds to the next command without waiting.
+/// To effectively use TOP and BOP commands, it is important to understand how they interact with rendering commands:
+///
+/// When the CP encounters a rendering command it queues it for execution and moves to the next command.  The queued rendering commands are issued in order.
+/// There can be multiple rendering commands running in parallel.  When a rendering command is issued we say it is at the top of the pipe.  When a rendering command
+/// finishes execution we say it has reached the bottom of the pipe.
+///
+/// A BOP command remains in a waiting queue and is executed once prior rendering commands finish.  The queue of BOP commands is limited to 64 entries in GCN generation 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
+/// If the 64 limit is reached the CP will stop queueing BOP commands and also rendering commands.  Developers should limit the number of BOP commands that write markers to avoid contention.
+/// In general, developers should limit both TOP and BOP commands to avoid stalling the CP.
+///
+/// \subsection eg1 Example 1:
+///
+/// \code{.cpp}
+/// // Start of a command buffer
+/// WriteMarker(TopOfPipe, 1)
+/// WriteMarker(BottomOfPipe, 2)
+/// WriteMarker(BottomOfPipe, 3)
+/// DrawX
+/// WriteMarker(BottomOfPipe, 4)
+/// WriteMarker(BottomOfPipe, 5)
+/// WriteMarker(TopOfPipe, 6)
+/// // End of command buffer
+/// \endcode
+///
+/// In the above example, the CP writes markers 1, 2 and 3 without waiting:
+/// Marker 1 is TOP so it's independent from other commands
+/// There's no wait for marker 2 and 3 because there are no draws preceding the BOP commands
+/// Marker 4 is only written once DrawX finishes execution
+/// Marker 5 doesn't wait for additional draws so it is written right after marker 4
+/// Marker 6 can be written as soon as the CP reaches the command. For instance, it is very possible that CP writes marker 6 while DrawX 
+/// is running and therefore marker 6 gets written before markers 4 and 5
+///
+/// \subsection eg2 Example 2:
+///
+/// \code{.cpp}
+/// WriteMarker(TopOfPipe, 1)
+/// DrawX
+/// WriteMarker(BottomOfPipe, 2)
+/// WriteMarker(TopOfPipe, 3)
+/// DrawY
+/// WriteMarker(BottomOfPipe, 4)
+/// \endcode
+///
+/// In this example marker 1 is written before the start of DrawX
+/// Marker 2 is written once DrawX finishes execution
+/// Similarly marker 3 is written before the start of DrawY
+/// Marker 4 is written once DrawY finishes execution
+/// In case of a GPU hang, if markers 1 and 3 are written but markers 2 and 4 are missing we can conclude that:
+/// The CP has reached both DrawX and DrawY commands since marker 1 and 3 are present
+/// The fact that marker 2 and 4 are missing means that either DrawX is hanging while DrawY is at the top of the pipe or both DrawX and DrawY
+/// started and both are simultaneously hanging
+///
+/// \subsection eg3 Example 3:
+///
+/// \code{.cpp}
+/// // Start of a command buffer
+/// WriteMarker(BottomOfPipe, 1)
+/// DrawX
+/// WriteMarker(BottomOfPipe, 2)
+/// DrawY
+/// WriteMarker(BottomOfPipe, 3)
+/// DrawZ
+/// WriteMarker(BottomOfPipe, 4)
+/// // End of command buffer
+/// \endcode
+///
+/// In this example marker 1 is written before the start of DrawX
+/// Marker 2 is written once DrawX finishes
+/// Marker 3 is written once DrawY finishes
+/// Marker 4 is written once DrawZ finishes 
+/// If the GPU hangs and only marker 1 is written we can conclude that the hang is happening in either DrawX, DrawY or DrawZ
+/// If the GPU hangs and only marker 1 and 2 are written we can conclude that the hang is happening in DrawY or DrawZ
+/// If the GPU hangs and only marker 4 is missing we can conclude that the hang is happening in DrawZ
+///
+/// \subsection eg4 Example 4:
+///
+/// \code{.cpp}
+/// Start of a command buffer
+/// WriteMarker(TopOfPipe, 1)
+/// DrawX
+/// WriteMarker(TopOfPipe, 2)
+/// DrawY
+/// WriteMarker(TopOfPipe, 3)
+/// DrawZ
+/// // End of command buffer
+/// \endcode
+///
+/// In this example, in case the GPU hangs and only marker 1 is written we can conclude that the hang is happening in DrawX
+/// In case the GPU hangs and only marker 1 and 2 are written we can conclude that the hang is happening in DrawX or DrawY
+/// In case the GPU hangs and all 3 markers are written we can conclude that the hang is happening in any of DrawX, DrawY or DrawZ
+///
+/// \subsection eg5 Example 5:
+///
+/// \code{.cpp}
+/// DrawX
+/// WriteMarker(TopOfPipe, 1)
+/// WriteMarker(BottomOfPipe, 2)
+/// DrawY
+/// WriteMarker(TopOfPipe, 3)
+/// WriteMarker(BottomOfPipe, 4)
+/// \endcode
+///
+/// Marker 1 is written right after DrawX is queued for execution.
+/// Marker 2 is only written once DrawX finishes execution.
+/// Marker 3 is written right after DrawY is queued for execution.
+/// Marker 4 is only written once DrawY finishes execution
+/// If marker 1 is written we would know that the CP has reached the command DrawX (DrawX at the top of the pipe).
+/// If marker 2 is written we can say that DrawX has finished execution (DrawX at the bottom of the pipe). 
+/// In case the GPU hangs and only marker 1 and 3 are written we can conclude that the hang is happening in DrawX or DrawY
+/// In case the GPU hangs and only marker 1 is written we can conclude that the hang is happening in DrawX
+/// In case the GPU hangs and only marker 4 is missing we can conclude that the hang is happening in DrawY

+///     // Read the marker data buffer once detect device lost
+///     if ( hr != S_OK )
+///     {
+///         for (UINT i = 0; i < g_NumMarkerWritten; i++)
+///         {
+///             UINT64* pTempData;
+///             pTempData = static_cast<UINT64*>(pMarkerBuffer);
+/// 
+///             // Write the marker data to file
+///             ofs << i << "\r\n";
+///             ofs << std::hex << *(pTempData + i * 2) << "\r\n";
+///             ofs << std::hex << *(pTempData + (i * 2 + 1)) << "\r\n";
+/// 
+///             WCHAR s1[256];
+///             setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "en_US.iso88591");
+/// 
+///             // Output the marker data to console
+///             swprintf(s1, 256, L" The Draw count is %d; The Top maker is % 016llX and the Bottom marker is % 016llX \r\n", i, *(pTempData + i * 2), *(pTempData + (i * 2 + 1)));
