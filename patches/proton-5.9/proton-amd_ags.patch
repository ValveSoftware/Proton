+/// AGS Library Overview
+/// --------------------
+/// This document provides an overview of the AGS (AMD GPU Services) library. The AGS library provides software developers with the ability to query
+/// AMD GPU software and hardware state information that is not normally available through standard operating systems or graphic APIs.
+///
+/// The latest version of the API is publicly hosted here: https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AGS_SDK/.
+/// It is also worth checking http://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/amd-gpu-services-ags-library/ for any updates and articles on AGS.
+/// \internal
+/// Online documentation is publicly hosted here: http://gpuopen-librariesandsdks.github.io/ags/

+///
+/// What's new in AGS 5.1.1 since version 5.0.6
+/// ---------------------------------------
+/// AGS 5.1.1 includes the following updates:
+/// * An API change for DX11 extensions
+///   - It is now mandatory to call agsDriverExtensionsDX11_CreateDevice() when creating a device if the user wants to access any DX11 AMD extensions.
+///   - The corresponding agsDriverExtensionsDX11_DestroyDevice() call must be called to release the device and free up the internal resources allocated by the create call.
+/// * App registration extension for DX11.
+/// * Freesync 2 HDR support.
+/// * Wave reduce and wave scan shader extensions.
+/// * AMD user markers for DX12.
+/// * Eyefinity bug fixes.
+/// * MultiDrawIndexedInstancedIndirectCountIndirect parameter bug fix.
+/// * Static lib versions of the binary.
+/// * VS2017 support for the samples.
+///
+/// What's new in AGS 5.x since version 4.x
+/// ---------------------------------------
+/// Version 5.x is a major overhaul of the library designed to provide a much clearer view of the GPUs in the system and the displays attached to them.
+/// It also exposes the ability to query each display for HDR capabilities and put those HDR capable displays into various HDR modes.
+/// Some functions such as agsGetGPUMemorySize and agsGetEyefinityConfigInfo have been removed in favor of including this information in the device & display enumeration.
+/// Features include:
+/// * Full GPU enumeration with adapter string, device id, revision id and vendor id.
+/// * Per GPU display enumeration including information on display name, resolution and HDR capabilities.
+/// * Optional user supplied memory allocator.
+/// * Function to set displays into HDR mode.
+/// * A Microsoft WACK compliant version of the library.
+/// * DirectX11 shader compiler controls.
+/// * DirectX11 multiview extension enabling MultiView and MultiRes rendering.
+/// * DirectX11 Crossfire API now supports using the API without needing a driver profile. Can also specify the transfer engine.
+///
+/// Using the AGS library
+/// ---------------------
+/// It is recommended to take a look at the source code for the samples that come with the AGS SDK:
+/// * AGSSample
+/// * CrossfireSample
+/// * EyefinitySample
+/// The AGSSample application is the simplest of the three examples and demonstrates the code required to initialize AGS and use it to query the GPU and Eyefinity state.
+/// The CrossfireSample application demonstrates the use of the new API to transfer resources on GPUs in Crossfire mode. Lastly, the EyefinitySample application provides a more
+/// extensive example of Eyefinity setup than the basic example provided in AGSSample.
+/// There are other samples on Github that demonstrate the DirectX shader extensions, such as the Barycentrics11 and Barycentrics12 samples.
+///
+/// To add AGS support to an existing project, follow these steps:
+/// * Link your project against the correct import library. Choose from either the 32 bit or 64 bit version.
+/// * Copy the AGS dll into the same directory as your game executable.
+/// * Include the amd_ags.h header file from your source code.
+/// * Include the AGS hlsl files if you are using the shader intrinsics.
+/// * Declare a pointer to an AGSContext and make this available for all subsequent calls to AGS.
+/// * On game initialization, call agsInit() passing in the address of the context. On success, this function will return a valid context pointer.
+/// * The agsInit() function should be called before the D3D device is created if the Crossfire mode is specified.
+///
+/// Don't forget to cleanup AGS by calling agsDeInit() when the app exits, after the device has been destroyed.

+/// This feature is supported in Radeon Software Version 17.9.2 onwards.
+/// Rules:
+/// * AppName or EngineName must be set, but both are not required. Engine profiles will be used only if app specific profiles do not exist.
+/// * In an engine, the EngineName should be set, so a default profile can be built. If an app modifies the engine, the AppName should be set, to allow a profile for the specific app.
+/// * Version number is not mandatory, but heavily suggested. The use of which can prevent the use of profiles for incompatible versions (for instance engine versions that introduce or change features), and can help prevent older profiles from being used (and introducing new bugs) before the profile is tested with new app builds.
+/// * If Version numbers are used and a new version is introduced, a new profile will not be enabled until an AMD engineer has been able to update a previous profile, or make a new one.
+///
+/// The cases for profile selection are as follows:
+///
+/// |Case|Profile Applied|
+/// |----|---------------|
+/// | App or Engine Version has profile | The profile is used. |
+/// | App or Engine Version num < profile version num | The closest profile > the version number is used. |
+/// | App or Engine Version num > profile version num | No profile selected/The previous method is used. |
+/// | App and Engine Version have profile | The App's profile is used. |
+/// | App and Engine Version num < profile version | The closest App profile > the version number is used. |
+/// | App and Engine Version, no App profile found | The Engine profile will be used. |
+/// | App/Engine name but no Version, has profile | The latest profile is used. |
+/// | No name or version, or no profile | The previous app detection method is used. |

+///
+/// The Quad List extension is a convenient way to submit quads without using an index buffer. Note that this still submits two triangles at the driver level.

+/// The hardware then uses the bounding box of the vertices to rasterize the rectangle primitive (i.e. as a rectangle rather than two triangles).
+/// \note Note that this will not return valid interpolated values, only valid SV_Position values.
