<!--
1. You can find the Steam AppID in the URL of the shop page of the game.
   e.g. for `The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt` the AppID is `292030`.
2. You can find your driver and Linux version, as well as your graphics
   processor's name in the system information report of Steam.
3. You can retrieve a full system information report by clicking
   `Help` > `System Information` in the Steam client on your machine.
4. Please copy it to your clipboard by pressing `Ctrl+A` and then `Ctrl+C`.
   Then paste it in a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and post the link in
   this issue to prevent chaos by too much info in one place.
5. Please search for open issues and pull requests by the name of the game and
   find out whether they are relevant and should be referenced above.
