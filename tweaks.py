This module lists game-specific tweaks, that cannot be handled by other means
(specifically tweaks, that are outside of dxvk.conf or Mesa scope, such as
additional environment variables, renaming files post-installation, changing
Wine settings for the specific game, etc.).  The purpose is similar to
"Install Scripts" *.vfd files distributed with games, except here tweaks are
provided by Proton community and not game developer.
