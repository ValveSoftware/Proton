/* These type definitions are used to represent a nondeterministic
   finite state machine that parses the specified grammar.  This
   information is generated by the function generate_states in the
   file LR0.

   Each state of the machine is described by a set of items --
   particular positions in particular rules -- that are the possible
   places where parsing could continue when the machine is in this
   state.  These symbols at these items are the allowable inputs that
   can follow now.

   A core represents one state.  States are numbered in the NUMBER
   field.  When generate_states is finished, the starting state is
   state 0 and NSTATES is the number of states.  (FIXME: This sentence
   is no longer true: A transition to a state whose state number is
   NSTATES indicates termination.)  All the cores are chained together
   and FIRST_STATE points to the first one (state 0).

   For each state there is a particular symbol which must have been
   the last thing accepted to reach that state.  It is the
   ACCESSING_SYMBOL of the core.

   Each core contains a vector of NITEMS items which are the indices
   in the RITEM vector of the items that are selected in this state.

   The two types of actions are shifts/gotos (push the lookahead token
   and read another/goto to the state designated by a nterm) and
   reductions (combine the last n things on the stack via a rule,
   replace them with the symbol that the rule derives, and leave the
   lookahead token alone).  When the states are generated, these
   actions are represented in two other lists.

   Each transition structure describes the possible transitions out
   of one state, the state whose number is in the number field.  Each
   contains a vector of numbers of the states that transitions can go
   to.  The accessing_symbol fields of those states' cores say what
   kind of input leads to them.

   A transition to state zero should be ignored: conflict resolution
   deletes transitions by having them point to zero.

   Each reductions structure describes the possible reductions at the
   state whose number is in the number field.  rules is an array of
   num rules.  lookahead_tokens is an array of bitsets, one per rule.

   Conflict resolution can decide that certain tokens in certain
   states should explicitly be errors (for implementing %nonassoc).
   For each state, the tokens that are errors for this reason are
   recorded in an errs structure, which holds the token numbers.

   There is at least one goto transition present in state zero.  It
   leads to a next-to-final state whose accessing_symbol is the
   grammar's start symbol.  The next-to-final state has one shift to
   the final state, whose accessing_symbol is zero (end of input).
   The final state has one shift, which goes to the termination state.
   The reason for the extra state at the end is to placate the
   parser's strategy of making all decisions one token ahead of its
   actions.  */
