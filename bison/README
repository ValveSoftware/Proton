This package contains the GNU Bison parser generator.

* Installation
** Build
See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation
instructions.

Bison requires GNU m4 1.4.6 or later.  See:

      ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.6.tar.gz

** Internationalization
Bison supports two catalogues: one for Bison itself (i.e., for the
maintainer-side parser generation), and one for the generated parsers
(i.e., for the user-side parser execution).  The requirements between
both differ: bison needs ngettext, the generated parsers do not.  To
simplify the build system, neither are installed if ngettext is not
supported, even if generated parsers could have been localized.  See
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bison/2009-08/msg00006.html for
more details.

* Questions
See the section FAQ in the documentation (doc/bison.info) for
frequently asked questions.  The documentation is also available in
PDF and HTML, provided you have a recent version of Texinfo installed:
run "make pdf" or "make html".

If you have questions about using Bison and the documentation does
not answer them, please send mail to <help-bison@gnu.org>.

* Bug reports
Please send bug reports to <bug-bison@gnu.org>.  Please include the
version number from 'bison --version', and a complete, self-contained
test case in each bug report.

* Copyright statements
For any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package,
note that the range specifies every single year in that closed interval.
