/* _GL_WARN_ON_USE (function, "literal string") issues a declaration
   for FUNCTION which will then trigger a compiler warning containing
   the text of "literal string" anywhere that function is called, if
   supported by the compiler.  If the compiler does not support this
   feature, the macro expands to an unused extern declaration.

   This macro is useful for marking a function as a potential
   portability trap, with the intent that "literal string" include
   instructions on the replacement function that should be used
   instead.  However, one of the reasons that a function is a
   portability trap is if it has the wrong signature.  Declaring
   FUNCTION with a different signature in C is a compilation error, so
   this macro must use the same type as any existing declaration so
   that programs that avoid the problematic FUNCTION do not fail to
   compile merely because they included a header that poisoned the
   function.  But this implies that _GL_WARN_ON_USE is only safe to
   use if FUNCTION is known to already have a declaration.  Use of
   this macro implies that there must not be any other macro hiding
   the declaration of FUNCTION; but undefining FUNCTION first is part
   of the poisoning process anyway (although for symbols that are
   provided only via a macro, the result is a compilation error rather
   than a warning containing "literal string").  Also note that in
   C++, it is only safe to use if FUNCTION has no overloads.

   For an example, it is possible to poison 'getline' by:
   - adding a call to gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE([[#include <stdio.h>]],
     [getline]) in configure.ac, which potentially defines
     HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
   - adding this code to a header that wraps the system <stdio.h>:
     #undef getline
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (getline, "getline is required by POSIX 2008, but"
       "not universally present; use the gnulib module getline");
     #endif

   It is not possible to directly poison global variables.  But it is
   possible to write a wrapper accessor function, and poison that
   (less common usage, like &environ, will cause a compilation error
   rather than issue the nice warning, but the end result of informing
   the developer about their portability problem is still achieved):
   #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
   static char ***rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE (rpl_environ, "environ is not always properly declared");
   # undef environ
   # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
   #endif
