//			different process or is local.
//
//			For most scenarios this is all handled automatically via SteamAPI_Init().
//			You'll only need these APIs if you have a more complex versioning scheme,
//			or if you want to implement a multiplexed gameserver where a single process
//			is handling multiple games at once with independent gameserver SteamIDs.
