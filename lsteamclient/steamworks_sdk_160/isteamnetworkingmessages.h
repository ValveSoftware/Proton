/// The non-connection-oriented interface to send and receive messages
/// (whether they be "clients" or "servers").
///
/// ISteamNetworkingSockets is connection-oriented (like TCP), meaning you
/// need to listen and connect, and then you send messages using a connection
/// handle.  ISteamNetworkingMessages is more like UDP, in that you can just send
/// messages to arbitrary peers at any time.  The underlying connections are
/// established implicitly.
///
/// Under the hood ISteamNetworkingMessages works on top of the ISteamNetworkingSockets
/// code, so you get the same routing and messaging efficiency.  The difference is
/// mainly in your responsibility to explicitly establish a connection and
/// the type of feedback you get about the state of the connection.  Both
/// interfaces can do "P2P" communications, and both support both unreliable
/// and reliable messages, fragmentation and reassembly.
///
/// The primary purpose of this interface is to be "like UDP", so that UDP-based code
/// can be ported easily to take advantage of relayed connections.  If you find
/// yourself needing more low level information or control, or to be able to better
/// handle failure, then you probably need to use ISteamNetworkingSockets directly.
/// Also, note that if your main goal is to obtain a connection between two peers
/// without concerning yourself with assigning roles of "client" and "server",
/// you may find the symmetric connection mode of ISteamNetworkingSockets useful.
/// (See k_ESteamNetworkingConfig_SymmetricConnect.)

class ISteamNetworkingMessages
{
public:
	/// Sends a message to the specified host.  If we don't already have a session with that user,
	/// a session is implicitly created.  There might be some handshaking that needs to happen
	/// before we can actually begin sending message data.  If this handshaking fails and we can't
	/// get through, an error will be posted via the callback SteamNetworkingMessagesSessionFailed_t.
	/// There is no notification when the operation succeeds.  (You should have the peer send a reply
	/// for this purpose.)
	///
	/// Sending a message to a host will also implicitly accept any incoming connection from that host.
	///
	/// nSendFlags is a bitmask of k_nSteamNetworkingSend_xxx options
	///
	/// nRemoteChannel is a routing number you can use to help route message to different systems.
	/// You'll have to call ReceiveMessagesOnChannel() with the same channel number in order to retrieve
	/// the data on the other end.
	///
	/// Using different channels to talk to the same user will still use the same underlying
	/// connection, saving on resources.  If you don't need this feature, use 0.
	/// Otherwise, small integers are the most efficient.
	///
	/// It is guaranteed that reliable messages to the same host on the same channel
	/// will be be received by the remote host (if they are received at all) exactly once,
	/// and in the same order that they were sent.
	///
	/// NO other order guarantees exist!  In particular, unreliable messages may be dropped,
	/// received out of order with respect to each other and with respect to reliable data,
	/// or may be received multiple times.  Messages on different channels are *not* guaranteed
	/// to be received in the order they were sent.
	///
	/// A note for those familiar with TCP/IP ports, or converting an existing codebase that
	/// opened multiple sockets:  You might notice that there is only one channel, and with
	/// TCP/IP each endpoint has a port number.  You can think of the channel number as the
	/// *destination* port.  If you need each message to also include a "source port" (so the
	/// recipient can route the reply), then just put that in your message.  That is essentially
	/// how UDP works!
	///
	/// Returns:
	/// - k_EREsultOK on success.
	/// - k_EResultNoConnection, if the session has failed or was closed by the peer and
	///   k_nSteamNetworkingSend_AutoRestartBrokenSession was not specified.  (You can
	///   use GetSessionConnectionInfo to get the details.)  In order to acknowledge the
	///   broken session and start a new one, you must call CloseSessionWithUser, or you may
	///   repeat the call with k_nSteamNetworkingSend_AutoRestartBrokenSession.  See
	///   k_nSteamNetworkingSend_AutoRestartBrokenSession for more details.
