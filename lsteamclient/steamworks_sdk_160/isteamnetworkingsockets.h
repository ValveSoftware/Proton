/// Lower level networking API.
///
/// - Connection-oriented API (like TCP, not UDP).  When sending and receiving
///   messages, a connection handle is used.  (For a UDP-style interface, where
///   the peer is identified by their address with each send/recv call, see
///   ISteamNetworkingMessages.)  The typical pattern is for a "server" to "listen"
///   on a "listen socket."  A "client" will "connect" to the server, and the
///   server will "accept" the connection.  If you have a symmetric situation
///   where either peer may initiate the connection and server/client roles are
///   not clearly defined, check out k_ESteamNetworkingConfig_SymmetricConnect.
/// - But unlike TCP, it's message-oriented, not stream-oriented.
/// - Mix of reliable and unreliable messages
/// - Fragmentation and reassembly
/// - Supports connectivity over plain UDP
/// - Also supports SDR ("Steam Datagram Relay") connections, which are
///   addressed by the identity of the peer.  There is a "P2P" use case and
///   a "hosted dedicated server" use case.
///
/// Note that neither of the terms "connection" nor "socket" necessarily correspond
/// one-to-one with an underlying UDP socket.  An attempt has been made to
/// keep the semantics as similar to the standard socket model when appropriate,
/// but some deviations do exist.
///
/// See also: ISteamNetworkingMessages, the UDP-style interface.  This API might be
/// easier to use, especially when porting existing UDP code.

	/// Creates a "server" socket that listens for clients to connect to by

	/// Usually you will set the IP portion of the address to zero (SteamNetworkingIPAddr::Clear()).
	/// This means that you will not bind to any particular local interface (i.e. the same
	/// as INADDR_ANY in plain socket code).  Furthermore, if possible the socket will be bound
	/// in "dual stack" mode, which means that it can accept both IPv4 and IPv6 client connections.
	/// If you really do wish to bind a particular interface, then set the local address to the
	/// appropriate IPv4 or IPv6 IP.
	///
	/// If you need to set any initial config options, pass them here.  See
	/// SteamNetworkingConfigValue_t for more about why this is preferable to
	/// setting the options "immediately" after creation.
	///
	/// When a client attempts to connect, a SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t

	/// A SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t callback will be triggered when we start
	/// connecting, and then another one on either timeout or successful connection.
	///

	/// Accepting the connection will transition it either into the connected state,
	/// or the finding route state, depending on the connection type.
	///
	/// You should take action within a second or two, because accepting the connection is
	/// what actually sends the reply notifying the client that they are connected.  If you

	/// This means that if your application goes for more than a few seconds without
	/// processing callbacks (for example, while loading a map), then there is a chance
	/// that a client may attempt to connect in that interval and fail due to timeout.

	/// Each lane has a "priority".  Lanes with higher numeric values will only be processed
	/// when all lanes with lower number values are empty.  The magnitudes of the priority
	/// values are not relevant, only their sort order.
	/// 
	/// Each lane also is assigned a weight, which controls the approximate proportion
	/// of the bandwidth that will be consumed by the lane, relative to other lanes
	/// of the same priority.  (This is assuming the lane stays busy.  An idle lane
	/// does not build up "credits" to be be spent once a message is queued.)
	/// This value is only meaningful as a proportion, relative to other lanes with
	/// the same priority.  For lanes with different priorities, the strict priority
	/// order will prevail, and their weights relative to each other are not relevant.

	/// Example: 3 lanes, with priorities [ 0, 10, 10 ] and weights [ (NA), 20, 5 ].
	/// Messages sent on the first will always be sent first, before messages in the
	/// other two lanes.  Its weight value is irrelevant, since there are no other
	/// lanes with priority=0.  The other two lanes will share bandwidth, with the second
	/// and third lanes sharing bandwidth using a ratio of approximately 4:1.
	/// (The weights [ NA, 4, 1 ] would be equivalent.)
	///
	/// Notes:
	/// - At the time of this writing, some code has performance cost that is linear
	///   in the number of lanes, so keep the number of lanes to an absolute minimum.
	///   3 or so is fine; >8 is a lot.  The max number of lanes on Steam is 255,
	///   which is a very large number and not recommended!  If you are compiling this
	///   library from source, see STEAMNETWORKINGSOCKETS_MAX_LANES.)
	/// - Lane priority values may be any int.  Their absolute value is not relevant,
	///   only the order matters.
	/// - Weights must be positive, and due to implementation details, they are restricted
	///   to 16-bit values.  The absolute magnitudes don't matter, just the proportions.
	/// - Messages sent on a lane index other than 0 have a small overhead on the wire,
	///   so for maximum wire efficiency, lane 0 should be the "most common" lane, regardless
	///   of priorities or weights.
	/// - A connection has a single lane by default.  Calling this function with
	///   nNumLanes=1 is legal, but pointless, since the priority and weight values are
	///   irrelevant in that case.
	/// - You may reconfigure connection lanes at any time, however reducing the number of
	///   lanes is not allowed.
	/// - Reconfiguring lanes might restart any bandwidth sharing balancing.  Usually you
	///   will call this function once, near the start of the connection, perhaps after
	///   exchanging a few messages.
	/// - To assign all lanes the same priority, you may use pLanePriorities=NULL.
	/// - If you wish all lanes with the same priority to share bandwidth equally (or
	///   if no two lanes have the same priority value, and thus priority values are
	///   irrelevant), you may use pLaneWeights=NULL
	/// - Priorities and weights determine the order that messages are SENT on the wire.
	///   There are NO GUARANTEES on the order that messages are RECEIVED!  Due to packet
	///   loss, out-of-order delivery, and subtle details of packet serialization, messages
	///   might still be received slightly out-of-order!  The *only* strong guarantee is that
	///   *reliable* messages on the *same lane* will be delivered in the order they are sent.

	// be in use on networks (both the Internet and LANs) in the same code as little
	// as possible.  At the time this comment is being written, they come from the
	// 169.254.0.0/16 range, and the port number will always be >1024.  HOWEVER,
	// this is subject to change!  Do not make assumptions about these addresses,
	// or your code might break in the future.  In particular, you should use
	// functions such as  ISteamNetworkingUtils::IsFakeIP to determine if an IP
	// address is a "fake" one used by this system.
	//

	/// Begin asynchronous process of allocating a fake IPv4 address that other
	/// peers can use to contact us via P2P.  IP addresses returned by this
	/// function are globally unique for a given appid.

	/// nNumPorts is the numbers of ports you wish to reserve.  This is useful
	/// for the same reason that listening on multiple UDP ports is useful for
	/// different types of traffic.  Because these allocations come from a global
	/// namespace, there is a relatively strict limit on the maximum number of
	/// ports you may request.  (At the time of this writing, the limit is 4.)

	/// beginning login.  Steam needs to know in advance that FakeIP will be used.
	/// Everywhere your public IP would normally appear (such as the server browser) will be
	/// replaced by the FakeIP, and the fake port at index 0.  The request is actually queued
	/// until the logon completes, so you must not wait until the allocation completes
	/// before logging in.  Except for trivial failures that can be detected locally
