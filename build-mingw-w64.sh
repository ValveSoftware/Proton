# The Story So Far
#
# We need two cross-compilers to build Proton. These each have to run in the
# Steam runtimes, each of which only supports 32- or 64-bit programs. Our build
# VM is a 64-bit Linux machine. So our platform configurations are:
#
# 64-bit cross-compiler:
#  Build (where the compiler is built): 64-bit linux (our VM)
#  Host (where the compiler is run):    64-bit linux (64-bit Steam runtime)
#  Target (what the compiler outputs):  64-bit win32 (PE files to be run)
#
# 32-bit cross-compiler:
#  Build (where the compiler is built): 64-bit linux (our VM)
#  Host (where the compiler is run):    32-bit linux (32-bit Steam runtime)
#  Target (what the compiler outputs):  32-bit win32 (PE files to be run)
#
# The former is a pretty standard cross-compiler setup.
#
# gcc calls the latter, where all of the platforms are different, a "Canadian"
# build. See "The GNU configure and build system" by Ian Lance Taylor, section
# "Canadian Cross", available here:
#     https://www.airs.com/ian/configure/configure_6.html
#
# This turned out to be quite difficult, possibly due to the added complexity of
# mingw-w64. I'm documenting the problems I had and how I solved/worked around
# them here, to hopefully save myself or someone else some heartburn in the
# future. If you are a compiler expert and find yourself shaking your head at
# this poor fool, I welcome your assistance improving this.
#
# Canadian builds require the build machine to already have a cross-compiler for
# the Target platform available on the Build machine. Without this, the gcc build
# will fail with:
#
#     i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -dumpspecs > tmp-specs
#     /bin/bash: i686-w64-mingw32-gcc: command not found
#
# We are building both C and C++ lang support, so we need both gcc and g++
# cross-compilers available. With the Build->Target cross-compilers installed,
# we can now build gcc, and use that to build mingw-w64. After that, we need to
# build gcc's libraries, like libgcc and libstdc++v3, against those mingw-w64
# libraries.  However, the libatomic and/or libgomp builds will fail with:
#
#     checking for suffix of object files...
#     configure: error: in `/home/vagrant/mingw/build-i686-w64-mingw32/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/libatomic':
#     configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables

#     See `config.log' for more details
#
# Digging into config.log shows it can't find libgcc:

#     collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
#
# I don't know what causes this (maybe Canadian builds don't like being split up
# like this?). However, installing libgcc explicitly first will work around it.
# After installing libgcc explicitly, we can then build the rest of gcc's
# libraries. That was all the easy (ha!) stuff. At this point, you will have a
# cross-compiler that will build Proton.
#
# However, there's a sneaky problem. For some reason the libstdc++v3 build system
# requires libstdc++ to be available to detect C-lang functions(?!?). It will
# still build without those C functions, but it may have far worse performance
# (see Proton github issue #3198). You can detect this situation by examining the
# config.log output for libstdc++v3 after your build completes:
#
#     configure:16811: checking for gettimeofday
#     configure:16827: checking sys/time.h usability

#     configure:16827: $? = 0
#     configure:16827: result: yes
#     configure:16827: checking for sys/time.h
#     configure:16827: result: yes
#     configure:16840: checking for gettimeofday
#     configure:16875:  i686-w64-mingw32-c++ -L/home/vagrant/mingw/output/i686-w64-mingw32/lib -L/home/vagrant/mingw/output/mingw/lib -isystem /home/vagrant/mingw/output/i686-w64-mingw32/include -isystem /home/vagrant/mingw/output/mingw/include    -o conftest.exe -g -O2 -fno-exceptions   conftest.cpp  >&5

#     collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
#
# But that error doesn't kill configure, and it happily continues with this in
# config.h:
#
#     /* #undef _GLIBCXX_USE_GETTIMEOFDAY */
#
# This triggers the bad codepath in libstdc++v3 that caused the performance
# problem mentioned above, and is clearly wrong anyway, as gettimeofday is
# definitely available. Yes, this was a huge pain to puzzle out. I "solved" this
# by letting the libstdc++v3 build continue, then re-running the build after
# installing it, so now it will find libstdc++ and so correctly detect the C-lang
# function that has nothing at all to do with libstdc++. Argh.
#
# After all that, we finally have a functioning set of cross-compilers. Most of
# the configuration parameters used here are taken from the Arch Linux mingw-w64
# PKGBUILDs, as those were written by someone with more knowledge than me, and
# have had a lot of testing. We make one tweak to the gcc configuration, which is
# to disable SJLJ exceptions and enable DWARF2 debug symbols. The former
# apparently helps with performance on 32-bit, and the latter puts debug symbols
# in a format that more Linux tooling can read.
#
# Side note, the Arch Linux PKGBUILDs work very differently from how this script
# works. While working on this, I tried to adapt the PKGBUILDs' process here
# (e.g.  build a bootstrap C-lang compiler, use that to build mingw-w64, then
# rebuild gcc against the mingw-w64 CRT with C++-lang support), but I ran into a
# ton of problems, possibly caused by the Canadian-ness of the build, and
# eventually ran out of ideas for working around them.
