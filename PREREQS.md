# GRAPHICS DRIVERS QUICKSTART - UBUNTU 18.04

Some of the newest titles available on Linux with Steam Play require cutting-edge drivers that are not distributed with the latest Ubuntu 18.04 release. To achieve the highest level of compatibility with Windows game titles, we recommend installing the following drivers:

## NVIDIA

Linux users with NVIDIA graphics cards should install the latest NVIDIA proprietary drivers; version 396.54 is required. They can be installed directly from Canonical's repository for third-party drivers:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-396
```

Provide your user password when requested and reboot after the last command completes to ensure the driver has updated correctly. Â 

Further details about this PPA repository are available here: 
https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa

## AMD/Intel

Linux users with AMD or Intel graphics cards should install recent versions of Mesa and LLVM through this repository: https://launchpad.net/~paulo-miguel-dias/+archive/ubuntu/mesa

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:paulo-miguel-dias/mesa
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers mesa-vulkan-drivers:i386
```

Provide your user password when requested and reboot after the last command completes to ensure the driver has updated correctly.

On Radeon R9 200/300 series you have to blacklist radeon module and add following parameters to amdgpu:

```
echo "blacklist radeon" | sudo tee --append /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
echo "options amdgpu si_support=1 cik_support=1" | sudo tee --append /etc/modprobe.d/amdgpu.conf
sudo update-initramfs -u
sudo reboot
```

After reboot check that vulkan is loaded properly:

```
sudo apt install vulkan-utils
vulkaninfo
```

In addition, AMD users that want to play VR games should also add this repository: https://launchpad.net/~kisak/+archive/ubuntu/steamvr4pk

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kisak/steamvr4pk
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo apt install linux-generic-steamvr-18.04
```

VR is not currently supported on Intel graphics.

# GRAPHICS DRIVERS REQUIREMENTS - GENERAL

## DirectX 11 games:
You will need NVIDIA 396.54 or Mesa 18.1.x at a minimum. LLVM7 or above is recommended to play DX11 games without GPU hangs.
## Core OpenGL games (DOOM 2016, Google Earth VR, etc):
You will need Mesa 18.2.0 at a minimum.

# FD LIMIT REQUIREMENTS

Proton uses the 'esync' patchset for performance improvements in multi-threaded games. It can require a higher File Descriptor limit per process than what it set up by default in some distributions. If you're not running Ubuntu, SteamOS or Debian, please follow the instructions over at https://github.com/zfigura/wine/blob/esync/README.esync to increase your FD limit.
